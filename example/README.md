The example file contains the significant-white-space (decurled) version of Root.hx

Note that this is NOT the official/latest version of Root.hx .  If you want that in sws format, decurl a fresh copy yourself from org/neuralyte/sws/Root.hx .

On this run I chose to use => to open function blocks, but you can choose any or no symbol for that, and also select where and when you would like it.
