When a user wants to provide a pattern to match some string or substring, he
should not be forced into providing a glob, or a regexp, or a fixed string, or
list of fixed strings.  He should have the choice.

I suggest we need a new all-consuming "matcher" type, which allows the user to
specify which method they wish to use to express the valid set of strings.
Perhaps the first char of their "matcher" could represent which method to use,
and the second char (if not ':') could be a chosen delimeter.

  s:LiteralString
  l,LiteralString1,LiteralString2,LiteralString3
  g:*.glob.199?
  r/good_ole_regexp/flags
  e/eregexp/flags

We might even allow extensions too, for example a Turing-complete function to
attempt the match.

skipFoldersNamed is one of many examples where this could be used.
